# Feature Specification: Browser Screen Reader Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-browser-extension`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I have a lot of text to consume daily, but I do a better job listening than I do reading. I'd like to build some sort of screen reader that could be used either in Google Chrome or Firefox when I have an article that I'd like to listen to. I would love for it to sound like a real human voice, but I don't feel the need to choose between voices. One is fine as long as it's quality is good. Ideally I could speed up or slow down the voice pace. Also, I'd like to be able to select an area in the article to start reading at. Oh and also I need to be able to pause and resume."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input 
   - Feature: Browser extension for text-to-speech reading
2. Extract key concepts from description 
   - Actors: users consuming text content
   - Actions: reading articles aloud, controlling playback
   - Data: web page text content
   - Constraints: Chrome/Firefox compatibility, quality voice
3. Extract key concepts from description - all aspects clarified during implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements 
6. Identify Key Entities 
7. Run Review Checklist
   - SUCCESS "All clarifications resolved during implementation"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user encounters a long article on a website that they want to consume but prefer listening to reading. They activate the browser extension, select where in the article to begin, and listen to the content being read aloud with natural-sounding speech while maintaining control over playback speed and pause/resume functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has the extension installed, **When** they click the extension icon in the browser toolbar, **Then** a popup appears with enable/disable controls
2. **Given** the extension popup is open, **When** the user toggles the extension to enabled, **Then** the extension becomes active on the current page with visual confirmation
3. **Given** the extension is enabled and active on a page, **When** the user selects a portion of text, **Then** the reading begins from that selected point
4. **Given** text is being read aloud, **When** the user clicks pause, **Then** the reading stops and can be resumed from the same position
5. **Given** text is being read aloud, **When** the user adjusts the speed control, **Then** the reading pace changes immediately without interrupting the flow
6. **Given** the extension is enabled, **When** the user toggles it to disabled via the browser action, **Then** all extension functionality is immediately deactivated
7. **Given** the extension is reading content, **When** the user navigates away from the page, **Then** the reading stops gracefully

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the selected text contains non-readable elements (images, complex formatting)?
- How does the system handle pages with dynamic content that loads after reading begins?
- What occurs when the browser tab loses focus during reading?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a browser extension compatible with Chrome and Firefox
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a browser action (toolbar button) that allows users to enable/disable the extension
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a popup interface when the browser action is clicked, showing current extension status and toggle controls
- **FR-004**: System MUST remember the user's enable/disable preference across browser sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST only activate reading functionality when explicitly enabled by the user
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide immediate visual feedback when the extension is enabled or disabled
- **FR-007**: System MUST convert webpage text content to high-quality human-like speech
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to select any portion of text on a webpage to start reading from that point
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide play/pause controls for audio playback
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to adjust reading speed during playback
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain reading position when paused and allow seamless resumption
- **FR-012**: System MUST integrate with webpage content without disrupting the original layout
- **FR-013**: System MUST use a single, consistent high-quality voice (no voice selection required)
- **FR-014**: System MUST work on any web page text content and intelligently focus on main article content while avoiding navigation, ads, and page chrome
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to click on any word or sentence to start reading from that position
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide visual highlighting of the current sentence being read to help users follow along with the speech
- **FR-017**: System MUST continue reading sequentially through all subsequent text content after the user-selected starting position until manually stopped or end of content is reached

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Extension State**: Tracks whether the extension is currently enabled or disabled, persisted across browser sessions
- **Audio Playback Session**: Represents an active reading session with current position, speed settings, and pause state
- **Text Content**: Webpage text that has been processed and prepared for speech synthesis
- **User Preferences**: Reading speed settings, extension enable/disable state, and any other user-customizable options
