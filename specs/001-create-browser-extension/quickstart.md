# Quickstart Guide: Browser Screen Reader Extension

**Feature**: Browser Screen Reader Extension
**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Purpose**: Integration test scenarios and user validation

## Overview

This quickstart guide provides step-by-step scenarios for testing the browser screen reader extension functionality. Each scenario validates specific user stories from the feature specification and serves as both user documentation and integration test specification.

## Prerequisites

- Chrome browser (version 88+) or Firefox (version 109+)
- Extension installed and enabled
- Test website with article content (recommended: news articles, blog posts)

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Article Reading

**User Story**: User encounters a long article and wants to listen to it being read aloud.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to an article page (e.g., news website, blog post)
2. Click the extension icon in the browser toolbar
3. Verify the reading overlay appears on the page
4. Click the play button in the overlay
5. Confirm that reading begins from the start of the article
6. Verify the current word is highlighted as it's being read
7. Observe that reading progresses naturally through the article

**Expected Results**:
- Extension activates without disrupting page layout
- Article text is extracted cleanly (no ads or navigation)
- Speech begins within 2 seconds of clicking play
- Voice quality is clear and human-like
- Current sentence is visually highlighted with background color
- Highlighting moves progressively through sentences as reading continues
- Reading continues through entire article until manually stopped
- Highlighting is removed when reading stops

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Overlay appears and is functional
- ✅ Speech synthesis starts successfully
- ✅ Article content properly extracted
- ✅ No layout disruption to original page
- ✅ Current sentence highlighting appears during reading
- ✅ Highlighting follows speech progression accurately
- ✅ Reading continues automatically through entire article
- ✅ Progressive highlighting moves sentence by sentence

### Scenario 2: Click-to-Start Reading

**User Story**: User wants to start reading from a specific paragraph or sentence in the article.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to an article page and activate the extension
2. Scroll to find a specific paragraph in the middle of the article
3. Click on the first sentence of that paragraph
4. Verify reading begins from the clicked sentence
5. Confirm that the clicked sentence is highlighted
6. Observe reading continues automatically through subsequent sentences
7. Click on a different sentence earlier in the article
8. Verify reading jumps to the new position and continues from there

**Expected Results**:
- Click detection works on all article text elements
- Reading position updates immediately upon click
- No delay between click and reading start
- Reading continues sequentially from clicked position through article end
- Highlighting progresses sentence by sentence as reading continues
- Previous position is abandoned cleanly when new position is clicked

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Click handler responds within 100ms
- ✅ Reading starts from exact clicked position
- ✅ Reading continues automatically through remaining content
- ✅ Position tracking updates correctly
- ✅ Multiple position changes work smoothly
- ✅ Highlighting jumps to new position immediately
- ✅ Previous highlighting is cleared when position changes
- ✅ Progressive highlighting follows continuous reading

### Scenario 3: Playback Controls

**User Story**: User needs to control reading pace and pause/resume functionality.

**Steps**:
1. Start reading an article (from Scenario 1)
2. Let reading continue for 30 seconds
3. Click the pause button
4. Verify reading stops immediately
5. Wait 10 seconds, then click play/resume
6. Confirm reading resumes from exact pause position
7. Adjust the speed slider to 1.5x
8. Verify speech speed increases without interruption
9. Adjust speed to 0.75x
10. Confirm speech slows down smoothly

**Expected Results**:
- Pause response is immediate (< 100ms)
- Resume maintains exact position
- Speed changes apply without stopping speech
- Controls remain responsive throughout
- Speed range 0.5x to 2.0x works correctly

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Pause/resume maintains position accuracy
- ✅ Speed adjustment works in real-time
- ✅ All controls respond within 100ms
- ✅ No audio artifacts during speed changes

### Scenario 4: Tab and Navigation Handling

**User Story**: User switches between tabs or navigates within the page while reading.

**Steps**:
1. Start reading an article
2. Open a new tab and browse to a different site
3. Return to the original tab with the reading extension
4. Verify reading state is preserved or appropriately handled
5. On the original tab, scroll to a different section
6. Confirm reading continues without disruption
7. Navigate to a different page on the same site
8. Verify the extension resets appropriately

**Expected Results**:
- Tab switching behavior follows user preferences
- Reading state persists across tab switches
- Navigation within page doesn't disrupt reading
- New page navigation cleanly resets extension
- No memory leaks or orphaned processes

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Tab switching handled according to preferences
- ✅ Page navigation resets extension state
- ✅ No audio continues from closed/navigated tabs
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable

### Scenario 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases

**User Story**: Extension gracefully handles various error conditions and edge cases.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to a page with minimal text content
2. Activate the extension and attempt to start reading
3. Navigate to a page with heavily scripted content (e.g., web app)
4. Try to extract article content
5. Test on a page with dynamic content loading
6. Attempt to use extension on a PDF or non-HTML page
7. Test with browser speech synthesis disabled (if possible)
8. Try to start multiple reading sessions simultaneously

**Expected Results**:
- Graceful fallback for pages without article content
- Appropriate error messages for unsupported pages
- Dynamic content detection works or fails gracefully
- Single session enforcement (or appropriate multi-session handling)
- Clear user feedback for all error conditions

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
- ✅ Extension doesn't break on unsupported pages
- ✅ Fallback behaviors work correctly
- ✅ No browser crashes or hangs

### Scenario 6: Cross-Browser Compatibility

**User Story**: Extension works consistently across Chrome and Firefox browsers.

**Steps**:
1. Install extension in Chrome browser
2. Complete Scenarios 1-3 in Chrome
3. Note any browser-specific behaviors
4. Install extension in Firefox browser
5. Complete Scenarios 1-3 in Firefox
6. Compare functionality between browsers
7. Test same website in both browsers
8. Document any differences in behavior

**Expected Results**:

- Voice quality consistent (within browser limitations)
- UI appearance and behavior consistent
- Performance comparable between browsers
- Any differences are documented and acceptable

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Feature parity between Chrome and Firefox

    const content = await activateExtensionAndExtractText();
    expect(content.wordCount).toBeGreaterThan(100);
    expect(content.extractionMethod).toBe('readability');
  });

  it('should start reading from clicked position', async () => {
    await activateExtension();
    const targetWord = await clickOnWord(50);
    const session = await startReading();
    expect(session.currentPosition).toBe(50);
  });

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Reading Doesn't Start
- Check if browser supports Speech Synthesis API
- Verify page has extractable text content
- Ensure extension has required permissions
- Try refreshing the page and reactivating

### Poor Article Extraction
- Check if page uses semantic HTML structure
- Try using text selection instead of auto-extraction
- Verify page isn't heavily dynamic or script-based
- Consider if page has unusual layout

### Performance Issues
- Check available system memory
- Verify only one reading session is active
- Test on simpler page to isolate issue
- Monitor browser developer tools for errors
